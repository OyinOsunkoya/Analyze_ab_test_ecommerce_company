### Project Title
Analyze A/B Test ecommerce company

### Description
I perform an A/B test for an e-commerce company to determine if implementing a new page increases the number of users who decide to pay for their products. I also run a logistic regression to compare with the results from the A/B test.

### Files used
ab_data.csv <br>
countries.csv

### Results
The A/B test and the Logistic regression results suggest that the company should not implement the new page. Furthermore, there is no practical significance for implementing the new page as the cost involved with launching the new page does not translate into more users deciding to buy their products.
